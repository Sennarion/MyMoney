## Functionality:

When you first open the MyMoney app we redirected you to the registration page
or if you already did registration - you can log in to your private account.

Inside the app, you have three different pages in mobile and tablet versions:
the Home page, the Statistics page, and the Currency page. But in the desktop
version, you have only two pages: the Currency page information is located on
the Home page. 

All your transactions are located on the Home page inside the
special table. You can add a transaction by clicking the button below the Home
page. 

When you do that, you can see the special modal window where you can
choose the type of your transaction, transaction category, amount, date, and
comment area. When you add all of your information about the transaction and
click the Add button - the data will be updated on the Home and the Statistic
pages. Also, you can delete a transaction after successful adding if you notice
some mistakes. 

On the Statistics page, we present all your expenses using a
doughnut diagram sorting your transactions by categories. The Statistic page
displays categories summary during the chosen period. Besides, you can change
the period of your visible transactions using selects.

## Technology stack:

The MyMoney app is the React app, where we as developers try to use all our
knowledge from JavaScript Bootcamp. 

For page navigation, we work with React Router and High order component that helps us with user token checking. We
employ Redux Toolkit for centralizing our application's state and enabling
powerful logic capabilities. We choose Redux Thunk and Axios for most of all
async\await operations. 

We use styled-components for styling our app. For increasing user experience we add a spinner that informs the user that data
loading is in progress. We create all forms inside the app by using Formik and yup libraries.

We hope you enjoy the MyMoney application!
